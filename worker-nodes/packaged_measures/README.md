# Packaged Measure Folder

This folder is used to ship packaged measures with the AMIs.

Current the only packaged measure is the StandardReports because it is run every simulation.  This folder will be copied into each data_point folder for now, but will eventually be part of the standard upload of the project and live in the scripts
