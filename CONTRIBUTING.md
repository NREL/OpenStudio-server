# Contributing to OpenStudio Server

We'd love your contribution to the OpenStudio Server! Here are the guidelines to make sure we can merge down your work ASAP.

## Want to write code?
Please! And thank you! For small bug fixes and updates, please fork the repo, make your changes, and submit a PR. Information about this process can be found on [OpenStudio's wiki.](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/wiki/Information-for-Third-Party-Collaborators) Significant features or substantial development requires a somewhat more formal process, described in the official [OpenStudio contribution policy](https://www.openstudio.net/openstudio-contribution-policy).

## Question about how to use the server?
The fastest way to get answers to questions regarding the server is to search through questions on [unmethours](https://unmethours.com), or submit a new one if you can't find the answer you're looking for.

## Have bug, need fix
If you experience behaviour while using the OpenStudio server that you believe to be a bug, please begin by searching through the [issues list](https://github.com/nrel/openstudio-server/issues) to see if the issue has already been reported. If it has, please do everyone a favour and adding a comment to the issue saying that you're experiencing the issue, and adding any additional information or details not reflected in the existing issue. If you are seeing the issue on a different operating system, please be sure to highlight that as well! If you don't see an existing issue that describes the bug you're experiencing, please open a [new issue](http://github.com/nrel/openstudio-server/issues/new) and follow the issue submission template.

## Feature request?
To submit a feature request please open an [issue](https://github.com/NREL/openstudio-server/issues/new) and fill out the the top of the template. If your issue is a duplicate or extension of an existing feature request, we may ask you to close your ticket and add to the previous request to keep the feature requirements clear. The more detail about the desired behaviour, the easier it is to implement and test the feature, so feel free to include mock-ups or workflow specs. For back-end requests in-particular, pseudo-coded tests are hugely appreciated!
