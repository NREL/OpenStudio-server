Description: This package provide functions for box-constrained
        multiobjective optimization using the elitist non-dominated
        sorting genetic algorithm - NSGA-II. Fast non-dominated
        sorting, crowding distance, tournament selection, simulated
        binary crossover, and polynomial mutation are called in the
        main program, nsga2R, to complete the search.
        This version is modified from the originial version in package nsga2R.
        This version is parallelized on F evals and can take both continuous and discrete variables.
