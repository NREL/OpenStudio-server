Description: This package provide functions for box-constrained
        multiobjective optimization using the elitist non-dominated
        sorting genetic algorithm - NSGA-II. Fast non-dominated
        sorting, crowding distance, tournament selection, simulated
        binary crossover, and polynomial mutation are called in the
        main program, nsga2R, to complete the search.
