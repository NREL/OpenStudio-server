Description: This package provide functions for box-constrained
        multiobjective optimization using the elitist non-dominated
        sorting genetic algorithm - NSGA-II. Fast non-dominated
        sorting, crowding distance, tournament selection, simulated
        binary crossover, and polynomial mutation are called in the
        main program, nsga2R, to complete the search.
        This version is modified from the originial version in package nsga2R.
        This version is parallelized on F evals and can take both continuous and discrete variables.     
        This package also provide functions for box-constrained
        multiobjective optimization using the Strength Pareto Evolutionary 
        Algorithm - SPEA-II. K-nearest neighbor density estimation, strength 
        value and raw Fitness, truncation operator are called in the main 
        program, spea2R, to complete the search.
