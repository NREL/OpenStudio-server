# Development with Docker

* [Install Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox). This installs Docker, Docker-Machine, and Docker-Compose

## Create Docker-Machine Image
If using Docker on Windows with VirtualBox then make sure to create a larger volume (e.g. 100GB) for development with 
more memory and cores (if possible). From the checkout of openstudio server in the dockerize branch:
```
docker-machine create --virtualbox-disk-size 100000 --virtualbox-cpu-count 4 --virtualbox-memory 4096 -d virtualbox dev
```

## Start Docker-Machine Image
```
docker-machine start dev  # if not already running
eval $(docker-machine env dev)
```

## Run Docker Compose 
```
docker-compose build
```
... [be patient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4hkPn0Un_Q) ... If the containers build successfully, then start the containers

Resetting the containers can be accomplished by running:
``` 
docker-compose rm -f
docker volume rm osdata
docker volume create --name=osdata
docker-compose up

# Or one line
docker-compose rm -f && docker-compose build && docker volume rm osdata && docker volume create --name=osdata && docker-compose up
```

#### You're done ####
Get the Docker IP address (`docker-machine ip dev`) and point your browser at [http://`ip-address`:8080](http://`ip-address`:8080)


## Testing

```
docker volume create --name=osdata
export RAILS_ENV=docker-test
export CI=true
export CIRCLECI=true
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml build
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run -d rserve
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run -d web-background
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run -d db
mkdir -p reports/rspec
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run web
```


# Deploying with Docker Machine

## Installation

* Install Docker-Machine
    * *Windows*: [Install Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox)
    * *OSX*: [Install Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) 
    
## Configuration - AWS

* If there is a firewall between your computer and AWS, then allow `port 2376` communication between the two. 
(This type of firewall is commonly seen in large companies with IT departments).
* Create a new VPC to house the analysis containers
    * Log in to AWS Console
    * From dashboard, select *VPC*
    * Select *Start VPC Wizard* for the quickest setup
    * Select *VPC with Single Public Subnet*
    * Assign *VPC name*, example: OpenStudio-Docker
    * Click *Create VPC*
    * Return to AWS Console
* Determine VPC IDs
    * Log in to AWS Console
    * From dashboard, select *VPC*
    * On the left, click on *Your VPCs*
    * Copy for later use the VPC ID previously created for the analysis (e.g. OpenStudio-Docker's VPC is vpc-e33af1db)
    * On the left, click on *Your Subnets*
    * Copy for later use the subnet id, region, and availability zone (e.g. subnet-24fda94a and us-east-1e)
    [us-east-1 is region, a is availability zone])
* Export AWS keys as environment variables
    * *OSX*
    
        ```
        export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-key>
        export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-secret-key>
        ```
    * *Windows*
    
        ```
        set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-key>
        set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-secret-key>
        ```
* Checkout OpenStudio-server repo and change to dockerize branch

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:NREL/OpenStudio-server.git
    git checkout dockerize
    ```
    
        
## Starting Cluster

* In root of OpenStudio-server checkout (on dockerize branch)
* Determine the save of the machine desired. Best to use http://www.ec2instances.info/ to select an m4.* instance. 
*(NOTE: Do not use T2 instances unless testing connectivity. For analysis use m4.xlarge and greater)*
* Make sure to create a larger root-size for the initial volume as this instance will store the results from the 
simulations.
* `awsdocker` is a user defined field defining the instance of the machine.
* Run the following command replacing your copied vpc, zone, subnet values. Select the best instance-type and Increase the root-size if needed.
       
    ```
    docker-machine create -d amazonec2 \
        --amazonec2-instance-type m4.xlarge \
        --amazonec2-zone e \
        --amazonec2-region us-east-1 \
        --amazonec2-vpc-id vpc-e33af1db \
        --amazonec2-subnet-id subnet-24fda94a \
        --amazonec2-root-size 500 \
        awsdocker
    ```    

* After the instance is running, export the docker environment variables
    * *OSX*
    
        ```
        eval $(docker-machine env awsdocker)
        ```
    * *Windows*
    
        ```
        <tbd>
        ```

* Configure Machine for OpenStudio-server
   
    ```
    docker volume create --name=osdata
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.deploy.yml up
    ```

* **IMPORTANT** If this is the first time running a cluster, then the security group that is automatically created needs
to be updated.
    * In the AWS Console, select *EC2*
    * On the left, select *Security Groups*
    * Find and select the docker-machine security group in the correct VPC
    * In the inbound tab on the bottom, click *Edit*
    * Click *Add Rule* and add a *Custom TCP Rule*, *port 8080*, from *Anywhere*.
    * Optional: It is possible to tighten the security here if desired (e.g. allow access from *My IP*). 

## Docker-Swarm
If there is a need for more that 32 cores connected in a cluster, then use Docker-Swarm. Instructions to follow.

## Running an Analysis

* Copy for later use the IP

    The command below returns the IP address. Note that the server is running on port 8080. 

    ```
    docker-machine ip awsdocker
    ```

* See instructions on running analysis from the [OpenStudio Analysis Spreadsheet repo](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-analysis-spreadsheet#running-analyses)
under the *Pre-configured cluster from external source* section.

## Stopping the Cluster

To shutdown the cluster (without terminating), then run the command below. Note that this stops the instances which can
then later be rebooted for reused later. The cost of stopped instances is only storage.

```
docker-machine stop awsdocker
```

## Terminating the Cluster

The command below will stop and remove the instances. **Make sure to verify in the AWS Console that the instances are 
removed**

```
docker-machine rm awsdocker
```

## Inspection

* Viewing logs
    
    Use `-f` to follow the logs

    ```
    docker-compose logs -f
    ```
* Logging into Docker instance

    *Note that everything is in Docker, so inspection is a bit harder*
    
    ```
    cd ~/.docker/machine/machines/awsdocker
    ssh -i id_rsa ubuntu@54.197.129.12
    ```
