This package provide functions for box-constrained multiobjective optimization using a parallel Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm II. Fast and Elitist sorting, crowding distance, tournament selection, simulated binary crossover, and polynomial mutation are called in the main program, spea2NREL, to complete the search.
