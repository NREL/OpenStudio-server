    <p>
      OpenStudio Server is a framework that enables measure-based analyses of OpenStudio models on the cloud.
      This framework takes advantage of parallel computing to run analyses such as sampling, calibration, and optimization.
      The OpenStudio Cloud Management Console allows users to manage analysis runs and visualize results through a variety of charts.
    </p>

    <p>
      OpenStudio Server is implemented in Ruby and uses R for statistical computations as well as dispatching runs to OpenStudio and EnergyPlus.
      Resulting data is then stored in a Mongo database and can be visualized in the Ruby on Rails web application.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before running analyses on the OpenStudio Server framework, an OpenStudio model must first be created via the <%=link_to "OpenStudio client application suite", "http://openstudio.nrel.gov" %>.
      The Parametric Analysis Tool (PAT) interface is then used to find and download BCL measures to be applied to the model.
      This information is then exported to a spreadsheet format and the cloud analysis can then be run, as shown in the figure on the right.
